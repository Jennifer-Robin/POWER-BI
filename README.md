 **1) SPOTIFY ANALYSIS**

 **Project Overview**
 
In the era of digital music consumption, streaming platforms like Spotify collect a vast amount of user interaction data. However, extracting actionable insights from this data to understand user listening behavior, album popularity, artist engagement, and temporal trends remains a challenge.

This project aims to address that challenge by designing and developing an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dashboard provides a comprehensive visual analysis of user behavior, top content, and usage patterns derived from raw Spotify playback history.

**Dataset**

File Name: spotify_history.csv

Source: Exported from Spotify playback history

Content: User-level listening data including track names, artists, albums, timestamps, and playback duration.

**Objectives**

Analyze user listening patterns across time (days, weeks, months)

Identify most-played songs, albums, and artists

Examine engagement metrics such as listening duration and frequency

Uncover temporal trends in user behavior (e.g., peak listening hours)

**Tools Used**

Power BI – for data visualization and dashboard creation

Microsoft Excel / Power Query – for preprocessing and transformation (if needed)

Spotify Data Export – for source data extraction

**Key Insights Highlighted**

Top Artists and Tracks

Popular Albums over time

Time-based listening patterns (hours, weekdays)

Listening frequency and duration trends

Personalized user engagement metrics

**Features of the Dashboard**

Interactive filters (date, artist, track)

Drill-down capability to explore details

Visual storytelling with KPIs and trend lines

Responsive layout for presentations


**How to Use**

Download the spotify_history.csv file.
